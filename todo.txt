the big problems are probably:
    - Enemy AI (DFS search should be appropriate, maybe w/ caching)
    - Level generation
    - Display code (can use sprite pack)
other things:
    - Camera for different-sized levels: Scrolling? Scaling?
    - Crossing larger gaps if you have a longer snake
Stretch:
    - Rare yerb which turn into "santa cruz" mode
        - Snake becomes banana slug
        - Apples become yerbs
        - Rotation/trippy filter
